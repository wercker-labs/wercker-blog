This is a short summary of this week's updates:

* A big update this week was that we've openend up registration so that anyone can [join](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/06/24/Opening-up-registrations.html) wercker. StartupJunce was kind of enough to cover this and briefly [talk](startupjuncture.com/2013/06/28/wercker-opens-platform/) to us about wercker.

* Alongside going into public beta, we redesigned the wercker homepage. Wercker's inhouse designer blogs about its design process [here](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/06/24/Creating-our-new-landing-page.html).

* Several wercker users went ahead and made some awesome [contributions](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/06/26/Developer-contributions.html), specifically regarding the creation of custom [wercker.yml](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/werckeryml/) files for wordpress and Clojure.

* Finally, we wrote up several tutorials; [how to get started with Rails 4 and wercker](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/06/25/Rails4-and-wercker.html), [using Node.js version 0.10.x](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/06/28/Nodejs-010x-on-wercker.html) and [how to deploy your Python packages to PyPI](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/06/28/Deploying-to-pypi.html).

Stay tuned for more updates this week!
