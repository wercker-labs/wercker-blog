We wrote up several articles on how to test and deploy your apps with wercker:

* [How to streamline your Middleman deploys](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/06/10/Streamlining-Middleman-Deploys-to-s3.html) went into how to set
up your deployment pipeline with [middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) and wercker to [Amazon's S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/).
* We also had a [tutorial](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/06/11/Gettingstarted-with-flask-redis.html) on how to test your [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) apps, backed by Redis with wercker, that was even featured on [Python Weekly](http://www.pythonweekly.com/)!

There were also some announcements:

* Wercker now supports RedHat's [OpenShift](openshift.com) platform-as-a-service as a deployment target, read the announcement plus tutorial [here](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/06/11/OpenShift-Support.html)
* Our [Heroku add-on](https://addons.heroku.com/wercker) is now in beta, we wrote up a tutorial on it [here](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/06/13/Wercker-heroku-addon-in-beta.html)

Finally, we wrote on how to [integrate](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/06/12/Github-commit-status-API.html) wercker with your commits and pull requests on GitHub.
