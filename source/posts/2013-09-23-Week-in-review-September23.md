This is a summary of this week's updates:

* Wercker now has [Android](http://www.android.com/) support, read all about how to get up and running with continuous delivery and Android development using Android Studio, in part 1 of our blog post [here](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/09/19/Gettingstarted-with-android-part-1.html)

* We received an amazing *thank you* from [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/) who recently ran their Front End engineering class. The class was using wercker for test-drivedn development and we sent them some stickers. You can read more about their academy [here](http://theironyard.com/education/academy/).
