<h4 class="subheader">
It's been less than a week since we announce the 
<a href="http://blog.wercker.com/2013/07/22/Announcing-the-Open-Delivery-platform.html">Open Delivery platform</a> and opened 
up the doors to the <a href="https://app.wercker.com/#explore">wercker directory</a> such that everyone can
create their own <a href="http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/boxes/">boxes</a> and
<a href="http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/steps/">steps</a> for their build and 
deployment <a href="http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/introduction/pipeline.html">pipelines</a> on wercker.

The response thus far has been amazing and we'd love to share some of the boxes and steps you guys have come up with.
