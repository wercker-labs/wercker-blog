Frans' wercker.yml file for his [Rails4](http://www.infoq.com/news/2013/06/rails4) application, uses the wercker Ruby 2.0 [box](https://github.com/wercker/box-ubuntu12.04-ruby2.0.0), a Postgres [service](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/services/) and contains [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) task that bootstraps his database. Finally, he runs his rspec tests using `bundle exec rspec`. For deployment, he leverages the `heroku-deploy` step, after which he runs a database migration script. You can view his complete [wercker.yml](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/werckeryml/) file below or check out the [gist](https://gist.github.com/frunns/5895115).

                echo "from location $(which ruby)"
                echo -p "gem list: $(gem list)"
