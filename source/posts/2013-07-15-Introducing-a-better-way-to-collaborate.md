<h4 class="subheader">
When we started out building wercker, we didn't just wanted to develop another continuous integration or deployment offering, we also wanted to create a better place where we could work together and communicate. Today we're excited to announce a new way to collaborate around builds and deploys on wercker.

For some time, we've had the **activity feed* on the right hand side of wercker which showcased what was going on across your projects. This feed could become very cluttered however, and as a result you were unable to distinguish projects and events from eachother.

We've now removed this activity feed in its entirety and have created a new home page for when you log into wercker.
