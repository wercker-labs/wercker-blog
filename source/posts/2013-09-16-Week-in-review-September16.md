<h4 class="subheader">
It's that time again where we review the week! We had a number of updates over the past two week so let's go over them.
</h4>

Signing up for wercker is [free and easy](https://app.wercker.com/users/new/).

This is a summary of this week's updates:

* We continued our posts relating to our Docker [beta](http://wercker.com/docker) with an in-depth article on how to test your Docker infrastructure using wercker. The [article](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/09/10/Building-and-testing-a-cluster-of-RethinkDB-Docker-containers.html) deals with setting up a cluster of RethinkDB containers and testing master-slave functionality.
