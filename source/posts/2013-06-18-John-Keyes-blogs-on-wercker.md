We love it when other developers find out what they can do with wercker on their own and John has blogged about some pretty useful things:

## Less and wercker

[Less]((http://lesscss.org/) is a stylesheet language that extends CSS and runs on [node.js](http://nodejs.org) or on the client-side.

John wrote a post on how to install Less either locally or globally on wercker, [here](http://keyes.ie/how-to-install-lessc-on-wercker/).

## Ignore files upon deployment

As [recently announced](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/06/13/Wercker-heroku-addon-in-beta.html) we've launched our Heroku [add-on](https://addons.heroku.com/wercker) in beta (sign up for the Heroku beta program [here](http://beta.heroku.com)). With the add-on, you are able to deploy your passed builds with ease.

In his [post](http://keyes.ie/ignore-files-when-deploying-from-wercker/), John writes about how to ignore files in your deployment pipeline, for instance when deploying to [Heroku](http://heroku.com).

### wercker.yml

Big thanks to [John Keyes](http://keyes.ie/) for writing up these posts! They also give some insight on how to customize the [wercker.yml](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/werckeryml/) and thus your build and deploy pipeline on wercker.

We'll be announcing some more updates on this front in the coming weeks so stay tuned! We'll also make sure [John](http://twitter.com/jkeyes) will receice some extra wercker stickers ;-)
