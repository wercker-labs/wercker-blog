<h4 class="subheader">
When we started out building wercker, we didn't just wanted to develop another continuous integration or deployment offering, we also wanted to create a better place where we could work together and communicate. Today we're excited to announce a new way to collaborate around applications, builds and deploys on wercker.

READMORE

For some time, we've had the **activity sidebar** on the right hand side of wercker which showcased what was going on across your projects. This feed could become very cluttered however if you had many different projects on wercker. As a result, you were unable to distinguish projects and events from eachother in some cases.

We've now removed this activity feed in its entirety and have created a new home page for when you log into wercker. You are now greeted by a **feed** that displays the various builds and deploys but also team-members joining or leaving an application.

Each event also shows the application icon, that you've all grown accustomed to for projects as well as [boxes and steps](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/07/22/Announcing-the-Open-Delivery-platform.html) in the [wercker directory](http://app.wercker.com/#explore).

You are now also able to comment on events; help your coworker when a unittest fails or congratulate the team on another successful release of your application!

It could be that you miss an event as you're deep emersed in code, the notification center has got you covered though. It keeps track of all the events that you've missed out on.

Wercker has been completely responsive from the get-go and we've made no exception for the feed and notification; thus you can check your comments on your phone or tablet as well.

We'll be making some more improvements to the feed in the coming weeks, so stay tuned. Feel free to send us feedback and your remarks on the feed, we'd love to hear your thoughts!
