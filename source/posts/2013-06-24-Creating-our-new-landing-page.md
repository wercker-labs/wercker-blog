### Introduction

By adding new features, improving workflows and listening closely to the feedback that our customers give us, we're refining [wercker](http://wercker.com) with each deploy.

At the pace we're all doing this, it is sometimes hard to keep our product homepage up to date to reflect al these changes and improvements.
Today we're happy to anounce a new version of our product landing page and in this post we'd like to take a moment and talk you through our design process and the end result.

As always you can sign up for wercker <a href="https://app.wercker.com/users/new/">for free here</a>

### 5 days

Instead of spending hours and hours wireframing, concepting and designing in photoshop,
we wanted to refresh our homepage in 5 days, and create a foundation that we can leverage at a later stage.

With that being said, we immediately started building a flexible grid using [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) from Zurb.
We created a block based layout whose components we could easily swap and combine, resulting in a spacious look and feel.
The new design is fresh and more in line with the current version of the actual [wercker](http://wercker.com) platform itself.

### Responsive

We wanted the new product page to be responsive from the get-go as most people read their email and visit interesting links from
twitter on their mobile device. The wercker platform itself has also been designed to be responsive from the start.

Furthermore, new customers are able to sign up from their phone or tablet, but also add an application to wercker from it.
When on the road our customers can keep an eye on their build or even deploy with a *touch* of a button.

### Middleman

Besides our [blog](http://blog.wercker.com) and [dev center](http://devcenter.wercker.com) this new landing page was also developed with [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) and deployed to [Amazon's S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/).
We're a big fan of Middleman and have [previously written](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/06/10/Streamlining-Middleman-Deploys-to-s3.html) about how we streamlined our deployment pipeline of Middleman
or [Jekyll](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/05/31/simplify-you-jekyll-publishing-process-with-wercker.html) applications to S3 on our blog.
