<h4 class="subheader">
We recently released the <a href="http://blog.wercker.com/2013/07/22/Announcing-the-Open-Delivery-platform.html">Open Delivery platform</a> that allows you
to create your own boxes that run your wercker <a href="http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/introduction/pipeline.html">pipeline</a> and the <a href="http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/steps/">steps</a> that make up this pipeline.
</h4>

After this announcement we got several questions from our customers on the ability to create private boxes. We briefly want to outline our thoughts on this.

Private boxes and steps are definitely on the roadmap for us, however as we feel that we and the community can still learn a lot from how these [boxes](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/boxes/) and [steps](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/steps/) can be leveraged and created, we are keeping boxes and steps public.

As such, when creating a project for a box on wercker which is private you are unable to add the [wercker directory](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/directory/) as a deploy target.

We'd love to hear your thoughts on this and if should speed up the ability to create private boxes and steps.
