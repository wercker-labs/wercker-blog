<h4 class="subheader">
It's that time again where we review the week! We had a number of updates over the past two week so let's go over them.
</h4>

Signing up for wercker is [free and easy](https://app.wercker.com/users/new/).

This is a summary of this week's updates:

* Our big announcement this week was that we're working on experimental support for [Docker](http://docker.io). Over the coming weeks we will share screencasts and posts with you relating to building and of course deploying Docker containers. You can apply for early access on our new [Docker landing page](http://wercker.com/docker). We also posted our first screencast on building and storing containers to S3, which you can view [here](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/09/06/Building-and-Storing-Docker-Containers.html).
