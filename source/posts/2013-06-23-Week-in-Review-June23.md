This is a short summary of this week's updates:

* First, we had an in-dept article on the [wercker](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/cli/) [command line interface](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/06/18/Spotlight-on-the-wercker-cli.html). We went through
the most common commands and showcased how you build and deploy a simple application to [Heroku](http://heroku.com).

* We had a [two-part](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/06/20/Getting-started-with-Node-Mongoose-MongoDB-Part1.html) [tutorial](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/06/21/Getting-started-with-Node-Mongoose-MongoDB-Part2.html) on test-driven-development with [nodejs](http://nodejs.org), [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org) and of course [wercker](http://wercker.com).
In this tutorial we deployed our app to Heroku with the help of the [MongoLab](http://mongolab.com) add-on.

* Our friend and wercker enthousiast [John Keyes](http://keyes.ie/) [wrote](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/06/18/John-Keyes-blogs-on-wercker.html) [two](http://keyes.ie/ignore-files-when-deploying-from-wercker/) [articles](http://keyes.ie/how-to-install-lessc-on-wercker/) on his blog, that went into how to ignore file in your deploy pipeline on wercker and another article on how to install [less](http://lesscss.org/) on your wercker box. We're going to have some exciting announcements on this front in the coming weeks.

* We also [presented](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/06/21/Introducing-our-new-add-app-flow.html) our our new workflow and interface for adding an application to wercker. A big improvement from its
previous incarnation.
