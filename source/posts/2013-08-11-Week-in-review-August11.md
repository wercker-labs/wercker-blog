It's that time again where we review the week! We had a number of updates over the past week so let's go over them.
</h4>

Signing up for wercker is [free and easy](https://app.wercker.com/users/new/).

This is a summary of this week's updates:

* We wrote up a [post](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/08/05/checking-code-coverage-with-gocov.html) on how to do code coverage for golang projects with [gocov](https://github.com/axw/gocov) and wercker.

* Alongside [HipChat](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/07/31/Add-hipchat-notifications.html) notifications, you are now able to add [Campfire](http://campfirenow.com) hooks to your [pipeline](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/introduction/pipeline.html) on wercker notifying you of failed/passed builds and deploys. Check out the post [here](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/08/05/campfire-notifications-for-wercker.html).

* We wrote up a post on [building an api with Golang and the awesome RethinkDB database](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/08/07/building-an-api-with-golang-rethinkdb-wercker.html) on wercker. The post was featured on [API Digest](http://apidigest.com/).

* We [described](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/08/08/Adding-simple-post-deploy-check.html) how to add post-deploy checks to your pipeline in the form of smoke tests.

* We're also happy to help out the guys and gals at [The Iron Yard](http://www.theironyard.com/) and their upcoming coding class. Also check them out on [twitter](https://twitter.com/TheIronYard)
