At wercker we're big fans of what Heroku has achieved with their Platform-as-a-Service and how they've increased developer velocity for all of us.

We've previously outlined how to use the Heroku add-on [here](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/06/13/Wercker-heroku-addon-in-beta.html).

Now that the add-on is in public beta every developer can follow this tutorial and leverage wercker for their deployments to Heroku!

Check out the wercker [dev center](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/deployment/heroku.html) for more information as well.
