This is a summary of this week's updates:

* We wrote a post on how to add a [staging environment](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/07/30/adding-a-staging-environment-to-your-blog.html) to your Jekyll blog which was featured on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6140302)

* Thanks to [Desmond Morris](http://twitter.com/desmondmorris) from [DoSomething](http://www.dosomething.org/) you can now do [continuous delivery](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/07/30/Drupal7-pipeline.html) for your Drupal applications with wercker. Desmond also created a Drupal Drush [step](https://app.wercker.com/#applications/51f7ae136b20d0a93e000a07/tab/details) which you can find in the [wercker directory](https://app.wercker.com/#explore)

* We introduced a way to add [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/) notifications to your applications on wercker. Check out the blog post on this [here](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/07/31/Add-hipchat-notifications.html)

* Finally, we wrote a [tutorial](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/08/02/Creating-your-boxes-with-puppet.html) on how to create your own [wercker boxes](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/boxes/) with [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/) and [Librarian-Puppet](https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet) so you can leverage wercker's [open delivery platform](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/07/22/Announcing-the-Open-Delivery-platform.html). This tutorial features a box provisioned with [memcached](http://memcached.org/).

We also had some awesome user contributed posts this week!

* [Luke Vivier](https://twitter.com/LukeVivier) wrote about [deploying anything](http://luke.vivier.ca/wintersmith-with-wercker/) with wercker to [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com)

* [Sebastian Gräßl](https://twitter.com/bastilian) gave us some love with a write-up on wercker which you can check out [here](http://bastilian.me/blog/2013/8/2/continuous-integration-done-right)
