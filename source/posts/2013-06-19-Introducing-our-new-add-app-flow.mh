At wercker, we love getting feedback from our users as it helps us finetuning
and improving the product in a meaningful way for our users. In this post we're
introducing the new <strong>add application flow</strong> that we just
deployed to production.

The initial reactions to our **flow** of adding an application on wercker were
that it was very quick to do so, but did not point you towards setting up your
actual [build](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/introduction/builds.html)
and [deployment](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/introduction/deployment.html) pipeline.

## wercker.yml

The [wercker.yml] file is a small DSL that allows you to set up this pipeline.

## The new add application flow

Our new workflow is consists of small steps that guide you towards setting up
your application on wercker but also points you in the right direction of
creating your pipeline using the `wercker.yml` file.

We first allow you to select your git provider, currently either
[GitHub](http://github.com) or [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org). If you've
already authorized wercker to connect with either of these platforms, we will
show this as well.

In the case of GitHub, you can even select between private and public
repositories (or both).

We now present you with a list of repositories and also show if a repository is
private, public and a fork of another repo.

Next, werckerbot

Done!

We think this new flow is a great improvement from our previous version, with
concise information but still allowing you to quickly add an application to
wercker.

It also helps you in creating your build and deploy pipeline using the
[wercker.yml(http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/werckeryml/) file, with sensible
defaults in place.

Let us know what you think, as we always welcome more feedback.

As always, signing up for wercker is [free and
