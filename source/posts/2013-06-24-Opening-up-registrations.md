READMORE

We're extremely excited that we've now opened up the registration process, so anybody can sign up, for free. While in beta you're allowed to have any number of applications on wercker with a maximum of two concurrent builds, limited at 25 minutes per build each. You can also invite an unlimited number of team-members to your projects.

Wercker has support for [Nodejs](http://nodejs.org), [Python](http://python.org) and the [Ruby programming language](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), but we're hard at work on supporting more languages, and have some exciting announcements on this topic coming up.

Please visit our [dev center](http://devcenter.wercker.com/), and the [getting started guide](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/gettingstarted/).

If you are deploying to Heroku, feel free to install our [add-on](https://addons.heroku.com/wercker), but make sure you're part of the Heroku [Beta program](http://beta.heroku.com).

Please keep in mind that wercker is still in beta and might be a bit rough around the edges. That's why we need your help!

We're looking forward to your feedback, questions and requests via [mail](mailto:pleasemailus@wercker.com), [twitter](http://twitter.com/wercker) and [GitHub](http://github.com/wercker/support).

### Earn some stickers!

Let us know about the applications you build with wercker. Don't forget to tweet out a screenshot of your first green build with **#wercker** and we'll send you some [@wercker](http://twitter.com/wercker) stickers.

Signing up for wercker is [free and easy](https://app.wercker.com/users/new/).
