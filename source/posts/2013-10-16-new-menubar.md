Not the worlds biggest change but we are happy
with the improvements we made on our menubar.

The menubar now hides itself after loggin in on wercker, showing only the icons that represent
the same menu and on rollover animates to show the full menu.

We wanted to create more focus on the content, so we ditched the topbar menu and combined it with our
sidebar. It brings all options together and makes a more clearer difference between navigation and
the tests / deploys you are running. And the nice thing is it animates really snappy and doesn't slow you down.

When frequently using wercker you get a quick sense of the menu and you don't need to think anymore
how to get from page **A** to **B**. We now can use the space for better showing data that mathers more
to the users.

The extra pixels we gain is best used experienced tablets, the menubar open and closes on touch and now more
then ever this kind of menus are widely accepted in apps.

We are constantly looking for this kind of improvements that make wercker a more mature application
and shows to our userbase that we are constantly improving wercker.

Luckely we have really awesome users who help us by giving us great feedback and have great new feature requests.

<h4 class="subheader">
We hope you like the new menubar so far and as always feedback is more then welcome.
