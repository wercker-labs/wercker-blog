<h4 class="subheader">
A mostly subtle change, but we are happy
with the improvements we made on our menu bar.

Our goal was to create more focus on the content and a less obstrusive navigation.

What we did is, combine the top bar with the side bar and designed a minimized version of the side bar.
The new menu now minimizes itself after logging in on wercker, showing only the icons.
On touch/rollover, it animates to show the full menu. The nice thing is, it animates really snappy
and doesn't slow you down.

When frequently using wercker you get a quick sense of the menu, it's there when you need it but now
in a more subtle way. The benefit is we can utilize the extra space for the more important stuff like
your apps and running builds / deploys.

The extra space we gained is best experienced on tablets, the menu bar open and closes on touch and
now more than ever this kind of menus are widely accepted in apps.

We are constantly working on these kind of improvements that make wercker better and a more mature application.
Luckely we have really awesome users who help us by giving great feedback.

<h4 class="subheader highlight">
We hope you like the new menu bar so far and as always your feedback is more then welcome.
