This is a summary of this week's updates:


* Our big announcement this week was the [Open Delivery](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/07/22/Announcing-the-Open-Delivery-platform.html) platform which allows every developer to create their own boxes and steps for their [pipeline](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/introduction/pipeline.html) on wercker.

* With the Open Delivery platform you can now explore boxes and steps in the [wercker directory](https://app.wercker.com/#explore)

* On the [wercker devcenter](http://devcenter.wercker.com), we created sections for [boxes](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/boxes/) and [steps](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/steps/)

* We showcased how to create a [RethinkDB box using Bash](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/07/23/Building-your-own-box-with-Bash.html) and how to provision a [CouchDB box using Chef](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/07/24/Building-your-own-box-with-Chef.html)

* In this post we highlighted how [steps](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/07/23/Spotlight-on-pipeline-steps.html) work on wercker with a [link](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/steps/create.html) on how to create your own.

* The response for boxes and steps has been amazing with developer contribution which we highlighted [here](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/07/26/Boxes-and-steps-in-the-wercker-directory.html). There is demand for private boxes on wercker, so we opened the discussion on this in a [post](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/07/25/All-your-boxes-are-belong-to-everyone.html) as well.

* We highlighted how to improve build time for #golang projects on wercker in [this article](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/07/25/improving-Go-build-time-with-wercker-cache.html).

* And last but not least, we created a tutorial for how to [publish your Jekyll site](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/07/25/Using-wercker-to-publish-to-GitHub-pages.html) to GitHub pages.
